//You are going to book a taxi. There are infinite number of points 1, 2, 3... on the X axis and your current position is cur. 
//There are N Taxis near you, and the position of those taxis is given as an array pos. Where pos[i] denotes the position of the ith taxi. 
//You are also given an array time. Where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith taxi to cover 1 unit of distance.Your task is to find the minimum time to board a taxi.
